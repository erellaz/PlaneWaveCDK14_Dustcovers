# Plane Wave CDK 14 Dust covers
Those are OpenScad files to 3D print a variety of dusto cover fitting a PlaneWave CDK14.
My CDK 14 has a Moonlite Nitecrawler focuser (the big one, aka WR35), and a Moonlite Sidewinder tilt corrector.

I built a vaiety of dust cover to protect the secondary mirror, a plug for the baffle connected to the primary, and a cover for the Moonlite dove tail.

Then on the focuser side, 2 plugs for the sidewinder.

I print those in TPU (so they are very flexible and resilient) at 40% infill.
